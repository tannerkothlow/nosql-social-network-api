# Week 18: NoSQL Back End

## Description

For our 18th week in our coding bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a simple, but powerful express.js hosted backend for a hypothetical social network using Mongoose. Creating an application backend is nothing new at this point, but the main point of the exercise was to get a hold on how Mongoose works and how to preform CRUD operations.

## Installation and Testing

To download the app, clone this repo to your machine and run `npm i` to download all relevant dependencies.

To test the various routes, run `npm run start` and make requests to `http://localhost:3001/api` in your API development tool of choice. (Insomnia is recommended).
